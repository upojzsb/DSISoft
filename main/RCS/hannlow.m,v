@function [dataout]=hannlow(datain,passband,stopband)

%[dataout]=hannlow(datain,passband,stopband)
%
%This function will filter your data using a lowpass
%Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter where a hanning window
%will be used.
%'passband' is the frequency in Hz of signal transmitted
%'stopband' is the frequency in Hz of signal not transmitted
% W<Wp is passed
% W>Ws is not passed
% A hanning window will be used in order to give a 
% passband ripple of 3dB and a stopband ripple of 40dB in the power domain
%
% Warning: The program does not check for unreasonable parameters
%
%This is based off of the theory developed in
%Digital Signal Processing by Alan V. Oppenheim & Ronald W. Schafer
