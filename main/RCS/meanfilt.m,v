@function [y]=meanfilt(x,n)

%[y]=meanfilt(x,n)
%
%one dimensional mean filter based on MATLAB's MEDFILT1
%called by 'fkfilt' and GUI module 'fkpoly'
%
%INPUT
%x = vector to be mean filtered
%n = number of points to use in mean filter
%   odd n => y(k) is the mean of x( k-(n-1)/2 : k+(n-1)/2 )
%   even n => y(k) is the mean of x( k-n/2 : k+n/2-1 )
%
%OUTPUT
%y = mean filtered vector
