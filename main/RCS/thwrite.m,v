%
%module for writing contents of an ascii file into trace headers
%
%INPUT
%datain - data in DSI format
%rec - record number to write information to
%thwords - vector containing trace header word numbers in the order
%that they are organized in input file ex. [1 2 15] (original
%trace number, FFID, pick times)
%thfile - filename containing trace header information.  Must be enclosed
%in single quotes

%Warning - no error checking, all previous trace header word contents
