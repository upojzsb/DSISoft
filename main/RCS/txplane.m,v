@function [t]=txplane(s,r,x,dip,strike,v)

% txplane: function to calculate the traveltime in a medium with constant 
% velocity v, given a source at s=[sx;sy;sz] and receiver at r=[rx;ry;rz], 
% with a reflection from a plane with given dip and strike, passing through
% the point x=[x;y;z].
% INPUT: s = [sx; sy; sz], source position
%        r = [rx; ry; rz], receiver position
%        x = [x; y; z], a point on the plane
%        v = velocity of medium (constant)
%        dip = dip of plane (horizontal -> dip=0 (degrees)
%        strike = strike of plane (clockwise from N in degrees)
% OUTPUT: travel time.
% Note, reflection point position is calculated but not yet returned.
