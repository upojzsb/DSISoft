[dataout]=slicefmap(datain,rec,flag)

This is a function that will slice up a fold map created by performing 
a 3D CDP transform on DSI data.  Use '<A HREF = "../6.display/dispseis.html">dispseis</A>' (DSISoft) or else 
'pcolor' or 'imagesc' (MATLAB) to view the results.

INPUT 
datain - the results of performing a 3D CDP transform on the input data
    format is a modified DSI variable.  File and trace headers still 
    exist but the .dat section has been replaced with a .fmap 
    extension which contains a cell array (records) of 3 dimensional 
    arrays.  This is the results of the 3D CDP transform.  There are 
    also .xsc, .ysc, and .zsc extensions, each containing vectors 
    describing the coordinates of the centre of each of the bins.
rec - record to work on
flag - 1 for inline (x) slices
     2 for crossline (y) slices
     3 for time slices

OUTPUT
dataout - typical DSI variable except very few trace header words will be kept
     start time, end time, and sampling rate will be stored as depth 
     rather than time
     each slice will be stored in a separate record
     CDP Northing, Easting and Elevation (trace headers 41, 43, 45) will 
     be stored where applicable, as will the CDP northing, easting and 
     elevation bin numbers (trace headers 42, 44, 46)
