[dataout]=cdp3d(datain,v,strike,dip)

three dimensional CDP (common depth point) transform
finds reflection points in 3 dimensions using rotations and ray 
tracing method
creates a 3 dimensional grid of bins, sums trace energy 
corresponding in the bin  corresponding to its reflection point for 
a given strike and dip of the geology, normalizes by the number of 
traces contributing energy to each bin
uses functions '<A HREF = "../3.cdpt3d/refpoints3d.html">refpoints3d</A>'

use 'solve3d' for a picture of ray paths and reflection points
use '<A HREF = "../3.cdpt3d/slicefmap.html">slicefmap</A>' to extract 2D vertical or horizontal slices from the 
3D volume these slices can then be displayed using '<A HREF = "../6.display/dispseis.html">dispseis</A>' 
(DSISoft) or else 'pcolor' or 'imagesc' (MATLAB).

INPUT
datain - dataset in DSI format
     shot and receiver locations and travel time information are 
     taken from the headers
     trace headers 31, 29 and 33 are shot easting, northing and 
     elevation respectively (x,y,z)
     trace headers 37, 35, and 39 are receiver easting, northing, 
     and elevation respectively
     travel time startime:samplingrate:endtime (file headers 9, 8 
     and 10 respectively)
v - <A HREF = "../8.main/velocity.html">velocity</A> of the waves (m/s)
strike  - strike angle in degrees from North (or mine grid North)
dip  - dip angle to the right, by convention, also in degrees

OUTPUT
dataout - the results of performing a 3D CDP transform on the input data
    format is a modified DSI variable.  File and trace headers still 
    exist but the .dat section has been replaced with a .fmap extension 
    which contains a cell array (records) of 3 dimensional arrays.  
    This is the results of the 3D CDP transform.  There are also .xsc, 
    .ysc, and .zsc extensions, each containing vectors describing 
    the coordinates of the centre of each of the bins.
