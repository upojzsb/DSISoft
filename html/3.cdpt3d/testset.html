<pre>
function [matfile]=testset(datain,nsamples);

 This function takes a representative sample of traces from DATAIN.
 NSAMPLES specifies how many traces are to be taken from datain, it
 should have a value of at least 3.
 The extracted sample traces are equally spaced.
 The code can probably be simplified (but it doesn't have to be!).
