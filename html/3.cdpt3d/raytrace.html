 [matfile]=raytrace(datain,dip,strike,pE,pN,pElev)

 This function creates a 3D plot containing source, receiver, and 
 calculated CDP points with ray traceing.  It assumes a constant 
 medium and a plane with a given strike and dip (in degrees).  
 The plane intersects the borehole at [pE;pN;pElev]

 DATAIN is a sample set of an actual dataset.  This is best created
 using the <A HREF = "../3.cdpt3d/testset.html">TESTSET</A> function, which creates an evenly spaced sample set.
 DIP - dip of plane 
 STRIKE - strike of the plane
 [pE;pN;pElev] - point on the plane (where it intersects the borehole)

 This function has been adapted from I.Kay's <A HREF = "../8.main/synplane.html">SYNPLANE</A> function, which
 creates synthetic data and also assumes a plane reflector.
