[fmap,out]=solve3dv2(shot,rec,tt,v,strike,dip,plot_flg,bins,bound)

identical to 'solve3D' except that calculation of reflection points is done
by function 'findref3d'
similar to 'refdip' (written by G. Perron) but works in 3 dimensions
calculates reflection points in 3 dimensions and plots them
uses function '<A HREF = "../3.cdpt3d/rotcoord.html">rotcoord</A>'

INPUT
shot and rec  - are x,y,z matrices of position
     shot 1 corresponds to rec 1, shot 2 to rec 2, etc.
tt - is a vector of travel times (s)
v - <A HREF = "../8.main/velocity.html">velocity</A> of the waves (m/s)
strike  - strike angle in degrees from North (or mine grid North)
dip  - dip angle to the left, by convention, also in degrees
plot_flg = 1 plots ray paths for reflections, = 2 plots fold map, otherwise
     only the points are shown
bins - a vector of number of bins in fold map in x, y, and z directions
bound - a flag telling whether to plot layers corresponding to the reflection points

OUTPUT
fmap - a 3 dimensional array that is a fold map (shows how many reflection points fall into each bin)
out - a cell array, where each cell corresponds to a shot-receiver pair, containing the reflection point coordinates
