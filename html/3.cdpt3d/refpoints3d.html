 refpoints3d: function to calculate the coord of 
 reflection points on a plane reflector. The event was recorded
 at time t. We assume a medium with constant <A HREF = "../8.main/velocity.html">velocity</A> v, given
 a source at s=[sx;sy;sz] and receiver at r=[rx;ry;rz], 
 with a reflection from a plane with given dip and strike
  
 INPUT: s = [sx; sy; sz], source position
        r = [rx; ry; rz], receiver position
        t = time at which the relctions is observed
            t can be a vector  
        v = <A HREF = "../8.main/velocity.html">velocity</A> of medium (constant)
        dip = dip of plane (horizontal -&gt; dip=0 (degrees)
              dip is on the right hand side of strike direction 
        strike = strike of plane (clockwise from N in degrees)
  
 OUTPUT: cdp=[cdpx; cdpy; cdpz].
