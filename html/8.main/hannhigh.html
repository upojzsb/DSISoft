[dataout]=hannhigh(datain,stopband,passband)

This function will filter your data using a highpass
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter where a hanning window
will be used.
'stopband' is the frequency in Hz of signal not transmitted
'passband' is the frequency in Hz of signal transmitted
 W&lt;Ws is not passed
 W&gt;Wp is passed
 A hanning window will be used in order to give a 
 passband ripple of 3dB and a stopband ripple of 40dB in the power domain

 Warning: The program does not check for unreasonable parameters

This is based off of the theory developed in
Digital Signal Processing by Alan V. Oppenheim &amp; Ronald W. Schafer
