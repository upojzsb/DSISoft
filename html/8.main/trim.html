Trim Statics
Used to align traces in time by making small adjustments.

T1 and T2 are the start and end of the time window that will be used to
align the traces.  A trace representing the sum of all traces in the
record will be created within this time window and this summed trace
will be cross correlated with each trace in the same time window.

tmax is the maximum time shift that will be allowed i.e. it cross
correlateion lag times will only be allowed between (tmax) and (-tmax)
and a maximum will be found between these lag times.

Time shifts will be stored in trace header word 25.

Convention: positive value = shift traces down
            negative value = shift traces up

Successive applications of this module will improve final trace alignment.
Similar to INSIGHT module 'trim'.
