  function [dataout] = harmon_new(datain,freq1,freq2,inter,t1,t2)

  <A HREF = "../8.main/harmon.html">Harmon</A> is a time domain notch filter.  Discrete Fourier
  Transforms are calculated to estimate noise phase and amplitude.
  The estimated noise is subtracted from the trace in the time domain.
  It has been rewritten to analyze a window of data from t1 to t2
  and then to apply it to the whole trace

  Usage:

  	Input:
		datain  : Input data
		freq1   : Start scanning at this frequency (Hz)
		freq2   : Upper frequency limit (Hz)
		inter   : Frequency step (Hz) such that ((freq2-freq1)/inter) is
                          a multiple of 10
               t1      : Start time of window (seconds)
               t2      : End time of window (seconds)

	Output:
		dataout : Output data

	Example :
		This is what I use to remove 60 Hz noise
		filtered = harmon_new(data,59.88,60.12,0.01,0,0.5);
