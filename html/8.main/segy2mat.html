[dataout]=segy2mat(filename,cross_wire_file,platform)

This function reads data stored in segy format, the oil industry standard
for seismic data exchange, and converts it into a MATLAB variable in DSI
format.  This module has been written to use a crosswire file to deliniate
trace header locations as there are many variations on the segy format.
The crosswire file is and ASCII file consisting of numbers only separted
into columns using either spaces or Tabs.  MATLAB-style comments can be
included in the file provided that they begin with a percent character '%'.
The file should consist of 5 columns: segy byte to start at (byte 1 is
beginning of a trace header), the format of this element (1 for 'char',
2 for 'int16', and 3 for 'int32'), a multiplier, a value to add to the
element, and the trace header word to store this value in the DSI variable.

See the following paper for a description of the standard segy format:
Barry, K.M., Cavers, D.A., and Kneale, C.W., Recomended Standards for
Digital Tape Formats, Geophysics, Vol. 40, No. 2 (April 1975), P. 344-352.

INPUT
filename - name of segy file.  Must be enclosed in single quotes.
cross_wire_file - name of crosswire file.  Must be enclosed in single quotes.
platform =	'l' for little-endian (PC) files
		'b' for big-endian (Unix) files

OUTPUT
dataout - data in DSI format
