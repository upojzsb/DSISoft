[dataout]=preddecon(datain,tstart,tend,lag,oplength,prewhit)

This program will perform a predictive deconvolution on the data
 datain is the input data
 tstart is the start of the window of data in seconds to be pred. deconed
 tend is the end of the window of data in seconds to be pred. deconed
 lag is the lag of the operator in seconds
 oplength is the length of the operator to be applied in seconds
 prewhit is the percent of prewhitening to be applied

 Warning: The program does not check for unreasonable parameters

This is based off of the theory developed in
Predictive Deconvolution: Theory and Practice in Geophysics 1969 by Peacock and Treitel
Seismic Data Processing by Yilmaz
