 txplane: function to calculate the traveltime in a medium with constant 
 <A HREF = "../8.main/velocity.html">velocity</A> v, given a source at s=[sx;sy;sz] and receiver at r=[rx;ry;rz], 
 with a reflection from a plane with given dip and strike, passing through
 the point x=[x;y;z].
 INPUT: s = [sx; sy; sz], source position
        r = [rx; ry; rz], receiver position
        x = [x; y; z], a point on the plane
        v = <A HREF = "../8.main/velocity.html">velocity</A> of medium (constant)
        dip = dip of plane (horizontal -&gt; dip=0 (degrees)
        strike = strike of plane (clockwise from N in degrees)
 OUTPUT: travel time.
 Note, reflection point position is calculated but not yet returned.
