[dataout]=equa(datain,fmin,fmax,fwind,taper,window)

Performs spectral balancing using a sliding frequency window linear <A HREF = "../8.main/bandpass.html">bandpass</A>
filter with tapers overlapping at the half way point.  An <A HREF = "../8.main/agc.html">agc</A> is applied to
each filtered signal and the frequency ranges are then recombined. Similar
to INSIGHT module EQUA.

fmax, fmin = maximum and minimum frequencies in the data (Hz)
fwind =      width of each <A HREF = "../8.main/bandpass.html">bandpass</A> filter to be applied (Hz)
taper =      width of linear taper of each <A HREF = "../8.main/bandpass.html">bandpass</A> filter (Hz) (around 2-5 Hz)
window =     length of <A HREF = "../8.main/agc.html">agc</A> window to be used (s)
