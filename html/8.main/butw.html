[dataout]=butw(datain,low1,low2,high1,high2,Rp,Rs)

Zero phase Butterworth <A HREF = "../8.main/bandpass.html">bandpass</A> filter.

low1,low2,high1,high2 - frequencies describing the filter
Filter is designed so that region between 'low2' and 'high1' is attenuated
by less than 3 dB and region before 'low1' and after 'high2' is attenuated
by at least 20 dB.
Rp - attenuation max within pass band (dB) (around 3 dB is good)
Rs - attenuation at outside frequencies (dB) (try 20 or 40)

All frequencies are in Hertz (Hz)

Note - uses functions from signal processing toolbox
