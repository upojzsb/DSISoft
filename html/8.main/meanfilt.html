[y]=meanfilt(x,n)

one dimensional mean filter based on MATLAB's MEDFILT1
called by 'fkfilt' and GUI module '<A HREF = "../7.fkfilter/fkpoly.html">fkpoly</A>'

INPUT
x = vector to be mean filtered
n = number of points to use in mean filter
   odd n =&gt; y(k) is the mean of x( k-(n-1)/2 : k+(n-1)/2 )
   even n =&gt; y(k) is the mean of x( k-n/2 : k+n/2-1 )

OUTPUT
y = mean filtered vector
