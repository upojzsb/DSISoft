function [matfile]=bison2mat(filelist)

This function converts a BISON formatted file into official DSI format.

INPUT
filelist - Name of an ASCII file containing either a single collumn listing
the names of the BISON files to be read into DSI format or else two columns
where the first contains the file names and the second contains an number
to be added to all of the channel numbers in that file (ex. for a survey
where two recorders of 24 channels each were used for each shot, the
channel numbers for one of the recorders could be incremented by 24 so that
the data can easily be sorted by channel number.  The name of the list file
must be specified within sigle quotation marks.  The channel number is
stored in trace header word 1.

OUTPUT
matfile - data in DSI format

DSI customized VSP processing software
written by E.ADAM based on a C program provided by J. McGaughey
