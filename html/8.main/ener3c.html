[dataout]=ener3c(datain,T1,T2)

This function will do energy balancing on the traces in datain based
on the amplitudes of the data in the time window between times T1
and T2 (both in seconds).  Each trace is multiplied by a factor equal to
the sum over the specified time window of one over the amplitude squared 
of the traces from the 3 components. This version preserves the
amplitude ratio between the components.
