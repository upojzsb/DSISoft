sortrec -&gt; designed to sort traces into records according to component
(x,y,z,r,or t); according to shot gathers, or in receiver gathers.
May later be extended to sort into CDP gathers.

function [dataout]=sortrec(datain,sort_flg1,sort_flg2)

sort_flg1 - variable indicating the trace header word containing the values
to be sorted by.  Traces with the same value in the indicated header word
will be grouped together.

Official DSI data protocol trace header number significance:
    2 - field file ID (FFID)
    3 - CDP number
    4 - component (1==h1,2==h2, 3==z, 1+n*3==r, 2+n*3==t, 3+n*3==rotated z)
     n above is number of rotations that component has been subjected to
    26 - shot ID
    27 - receiver ID

sort_flg2 - trace header word containing variable to sort traces within record
by, example wire line depth.  If sort_flg2 is left out or set to zero then
the traces will not be sorted within the record.
