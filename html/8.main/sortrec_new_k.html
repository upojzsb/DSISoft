<pre>
sortrec_new_k -&gt; designed to sort traces into records according to component
(x,y,z,r,or t); according to shot gathers, or in receiver gathers.
May later be extended to sort into CDP gathers.

[dataout]=sortrec_new_k(datain,sort_vec)

sort_vec = a vector of trace header numbers to be used for sorting
    first entry used to sort traces into records by, subsequent 
    entries are used to sort traces within records with decreasing order
    of importance, much like an alphebetization scheme
    sort_vec can be a single number if sorting within records is not desired

Official DSI data protocol trace header number significance:
    2 - field file ID (FFID)
    3 - CDP number
    4 - component (1==h1,2==h2, 3==z, 1+n*3==r, 2+n*3==t, 3+n*3==rotated z)
     n above is number of rotations that component has been subjected to
    26 - shot ID
    27 - receiver ID


Warning: NO checking done for valid trace header words
