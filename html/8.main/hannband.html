 [dataout]=hannband(datain,lowstop,lowpass,highpass,highstop)

This function will filter your data using a <A HREF = "../8.main/bandpass.html">bandpass</A>
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter where a hanning window
will be used.
'lowstop' is the frequency in Hz below which the signal is not transmitted
'lowpass' is the frequency in Hz above which the signal is transmitted
'highpass' is the frequency in Hz below which the signal is transmitted
'highstop' is the frequency in Hz above which the signal is not transmitted

 A hanning window will be used in order to give a 
 passband ripple of 3dB and a stopband ripple of 40dB in the power domain

 Warning: The program does not check for unreasonable parameters

This is based off of the theory developed in
Digital Signal Processing by Alan V. Oppenheim &amp; Ronald W. Schafer
