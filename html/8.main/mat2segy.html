 mat2segy(datain,filename,crosswire,platform,reel_id_header)

 This function stores a DSI variable in SEG-Y format.

 This module has been written to use a crosswire file to designate
 trace header locations. 

 This is the same crosswire file as used for '<A HREF = "../8.main/segy2mat.html">segy2mat</A>'.

 The crosswire file is and ASCII file consisting of numbers only separted
 into columns using either spaces or Tabs.  MATLAB-style comments can be
 included in the file provided that they begin with a percent character '%'.
 The file should consist of 5 columns: segy byte to start at (byte 1 is
 beginning of a trace header), the format of this element (1 for 'char',
 2 for 'int16', and 3 for 'int32'), a divisor, a subtractve constant 
 and the DSI trace header word where this value is stored. 

 For segy-mat(dsi) the multiplier is applied before the additive constant, 
 so for mat(dsi) -&gt; segy the subtractive constant is applied before the
 divisor.

 The SEG-Y format is defined in:
 Barry, K.M., Cavers, D.A., and Kneale, C.W., Recomended Standards for
 Digital Tape Formats, Geophysics, Vol. 40, No. 2 (April 1975), P. 344-352.

 This script's output is not standard SEG-Y.  The values are stored as native
 floating point format, rather than IBM floating point format. 


INPUT
datain - seismic data in DSI format
filename - name of segy file.  Must be enclosed in single quotes.
cross_wire_file - name of crosswire file.  Must be enclosed in single quotes.
platform =	'l' for little-endian (PC) files
		'b' for big-endian (Unix) files
reel_id_header - string variable containing a description of the file
	this string will be stored in the reel identification header of
	the segy file
