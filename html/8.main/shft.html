[dataout]=shft(datain,scale,word)

This function requires input data in DSI format.
A time shift will be applied or removed on a per trace basis
by an amount given in trace header word 'word'.
Shifts are to the nearest sampling point. 

scale is what the desired time shifts will be multiplied by
1.0: Apply static shift
-1.0: Remove previously applied shifts

word is the trace header word containing the time in seconds
by which the trace is to be shifted

Shifts will be applied to all traces and records.

Convention: positive value = shift traces down
            negative value = shift traces up

 Warning: Program does not check for reasonable parameters
