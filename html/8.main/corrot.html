corrot -&gt; function to rotate components of 3-C borehole data (DSI etc.)
into radial and transverse components using matrix eigenvalue algorithm.

function [dataout]=corrot(datain,headw1,tint,comp1,comp2)


INPUT VARIABLES
'datain' must be in official DSI data format
Each record must represent a component h1, h2, or z.
This can be achieved using '<A HREF = "../8.main/sortrec.html">sortrec</A>'.

headw1 = 	header word containing first break picks
tint =     half width of time window to use around first breaks (s)
comp1 =    record representing one of the components to be rotated
comp2 =    record number of other component to be rotated

OUTPUT VARIABLES
Trace header word 4 contains component information.
This word will be incremented by 3 for components that have
been rotated.

By convention: h1=&gt;1; h2=&gt;2; z=&gt;3; radial or oriented horizontal=&gt;4;
transverse horizontal=&gt;5; direct P-arrival (Pd)=&gt;6; orthoganal
component to Pd=&gt;7 (see Handbook of Geophysical Exploration, sect.1,vol.14B).  
Components 6 and 7 are the results of rotating 3 and 4; 4 and 5 are
the results of rotating 1 and 2.
The largest singular value of the covarience matrix is stored in header
word 10, and the ratio of sigular value 2 to singular value 1 is stored 
in word 11.
