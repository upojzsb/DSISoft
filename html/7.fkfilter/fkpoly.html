fkpoly

Interactive module used to pick a polygone for fk filtering.  The option is now
available to view results of filtering using user selected polygon within the
module.  For processing data, polygon is usually picked in the program then
passed to the '<A HREF = "../7.fkfilter/fkfilt.html">fkfilt</A>' processing module from a processing script.

INPUT
input parameters should be specified in the menu of this module.
Data should be in DSI format.
Max. Freq. is the maximum frequency to be examined in the data
dx is the spacing between traces
the 'polygone' input parameter is optional.  It allows visualization of
polygones that have been saved previously

OUTPUT
x,y coordinates of the corners of filter polygone; give name at prompt

There are buttons on the display screen for zoom, full (zooming out),
menu (brings menu screen to the front), quit (exits program, prompts for
name of variable in which to save picked polygon), pick (initiates picking
of a new polygone.  Pick with left mouse button, use right button to close
polygon) and clear (clears existing polygon from screen).  There are four
radio buttons that control the display.  'FK' displays the fk spectrum and
allows picking, 'unfiltered' displays the unfiltered data, 'pass' displays
the data with a pass filter applied and 'reject' does the same except the
contents of the polygone is rejected.
