stores pick times as indexes in variable 'ptimes'

picking is done as follows:
	first mouse button: clears a single trace pick
	second mouse button: selects a single trace pick
	third mouse button: starts dragging a line
	  followed by 1st or 3d button: erases picks on all selected traces
	  followed by 2nd button: picks times on all selected traces
