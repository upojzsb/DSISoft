<pre>
 This is the machine-generated representation of a Handle Graphics object
 and its children.  Note that handle values may change when these objects
 are re-created. This may cause problems with any callbacks written to
 depend on the value of the handle at the time the object was saved.

 To reopen this object, just type the name of the M-file at the MATLAB
 prompt. The M-file and its associated MAT-file must be on your path.
